## Setup

To replicate our results we suggest setting up a conda environment (or any other virtual environment) and then installing the required packages:

```bash
conda create -n ml4hc python=3.10 pip
conda activate ml4hc
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Data
For part 1, the data is stored in the `data` directory of the `task1` folder. For part 2, you can download the Pneumonia dataset from 
[Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/paultimothymooney/chest-xray-pneumonia) and create a directory `data` in the `task2` directory. Place the downloaded Pneumonia data in the `data` directory.

## Model Weights
For part 1, the model weights are stored in the `models` directory of the `task1` folder. For part 2, you can download the model weights from [Polybox](https://polybox.ethz.ch/index.php/s/HnIVNu2977hSQzV) using password `ml4hc`. After downloading these weights, create a directory `models` in the `task2` directory and place the weights there.
