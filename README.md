## Projects Overview

### Project 1: Interpretable and Explainable Classification for Medical Data
Project 1 focuses on the development of interpretable and explainable machine learning models for medical diagnosis using tabular and imaging data. For a detailed explanation of the project structure, dependencies, and instructions on how to run the code, please refer to the README in the `project1` directory.

[Project 1 README](project1/README.md)

### Project 2: Time Series and Representation Learning
Project 2 explores machine learning models for time-series data in healthcare, emphasizing transfer learning and representation learning to enhance model performance across different datasets. For more information on the architecture, dependencies, and execution instructions, see the README in the `project2` directory.
